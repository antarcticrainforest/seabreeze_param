The overall dependence of the formation of clouds and rainfall near coasts on large-scale weather patterns is weaker than over the open ocean or inland areas. This is due to the fact that clouds and rainfall are often influenced by land-sea-breezes; local winds that blow on and off-shore along the coastline. As these breezes are not included in current weather and climate models rainfall near coasts is poorly simulated in these models. This GitHub page presents an algorithm, or trigger, that is used as a parametrisation fo land-sea-breezes. The presented code can be applied to inform a cumulus parametrization scheme model to increase the occurrence of convective clouds when land-see-breezes are diagnosed to be important. A detailed scientific description of the algorithm can be found in [Bergemann et al. (2017)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017MS001048/full)
